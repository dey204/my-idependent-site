 	<h1>Jordan's <img src="images/download (6).jpg" width="327" height="216" alt=""/></h1>
 	<p>Jordan's are our #1 favorite shoe. Jordan sneakers were originally designed for Michael Jordan in 1984 but in late 1984 they were released into the public. Nike threw nearly all of their money into the deal with Michael Jordan which was a huge risk. Jordan originally wanted to sign with Adidas but needed up signing with Nike because his parents told him to.Â Jordan laughed at the &ldquo;Air Jordan&rdquo; name, hated the look of the shoe and almost skipped the meeting with Nike. Peter Moore was the man who designed and made the very first pair of Jordans.The design of the Jordan's 3 shoe stopped Michael Jordan from leaving Nike to go to Adidas.The original Air Jordan's made Nike $2.3 million within the first two months of being available to the public.The first Jordan shoe was only $60 but the prices went up expeditiously.The Air Jordan 2's were the first shoe to cost more than $100. The high cost of Air Jordan's and their popularity led to a lot of muggings and murders over the shoes in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the majority where young people.The Jordan Brand stretches from shoes to clothing and gear, including bags, backpacks and hats. The Jordan Brand shoes remain among the current 10 top selling athletic shoes since the 80s.Each time Michael Jordan would wear his Jordan's on the court he would get fined $5000 by the NBA for violating the uniform policy,but that actually helped promote the shoes. The Jump man logo came from when Michael Jordan wore his Jordan 3's during a dunk contest which he won.The Jordan 6's were the first shoe with a spoiler on the back to help wearers get them on and off.The Jordan 14's were the last shoes MJ wore as a Chicago Bull, the shoe was inspired by Jordan's Ferrari.</p>
